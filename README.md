- _Programmers just need to learn cooking; and then ...._



What are the lessons we can learn from Wework, arguably the biggest blunder in the history of shared economy startups? 

It is liquidity. By liquidity, we do not just mean liquidity of money, but also that of knowledge.

Consider food delivery services. No doubt they have created many jobs for low level skill people. However, there is not much sharing of knowledge, or liquidity of knowledge, ie. training for career advancement amongst the delivery personnel. 

On the other hand, cooks are a matured industry, with well established training and career development pathways. 

So the first question is:

- What relates Wework, food delivery riders, cooks and Airbnb?

Let's break this down to a simpler question:

- Is it possible to create a share economy platform for cooks?

The answer is a cooking class party &mdash; 

- a chef recruits 5 apprentice; each apprentice gets 5 friends; - each friend pays USD 10 up front for the party; - chef leads students to buy materials using the funds collected from friends;- chef and students cook for friends; - extra materials are cooked, packed and sold; - profits are paid back to cook, students and friends.

This one simple paragraph covers a classic investment life cycle worthy of an MBA class: everything from investment (funds from friends) to dividends (profits paid pack) within a few days, as well as sharing knowledge (cooking, marketing, management etc.) and contacts (friends of friends).

3) How does the cooking class party (CCP) relate to Wework?

- Acute readers might have notice the acronym of cooking class party relates to a top taboo word in the freedom loving America. (LOLOL!!!)

Wework's Achilles's heels is exactly liquidity. It needs to generate cash income from its investments in real estates. 

Of course we do not even expect anyone from Wework would listen to our suggestions, for if there is one thing we have learned from the past, that is human nature has become so bad that good ideas will be rejected by bad people at the top to save face, to futher personal interests until it is no longer sustainable.

Assuming as little as possible about Wework's business, we making the following assumptions concerning the "bleeding" factors of Wework (or any similar businesses):

i) Some tenants of Wework are not making money.

ii) Some facilities of Wework have a hard time finding tenants.

In any case, we may also assume that Wework facilities are strategically located in the best spots in big hot urban areas.

As Cooking Class Parties has the same acronym as China Communist Party, we should not be ashamed to say that turning Wework facilities into "community kitchens" (having the same root as "Communism" too) might just be the magic potion that it needs to save itself.

In fact, from the operational perspective, what is required might just be a "minor upgrade" of kitchens in Wework facilities, so that it is large and well equipped enough to sustain the head count in the non-kitchen floor space.

Then of course, the next question is planning permissions &mdash; which in turn are related to to local authorities ....

We suppose the "startup gurus" in Wework board should be intelligent enough to figure out the rest. What we cannot predict are just the excuses they might use to reject this idea. (LOLOL!!!)


4. Let's call this business "Les Nomades Mobile" if CCP is too much a taboo for some readers.

We will be frank we are not even sure if this name is correct grammatically in French. By definition, nomads are mobile people. Adding a "mobile" suffix is purely to emphasize to English readers its closeness to mobile social media, and to differentiate it with one Michelin class restaurant somewhere, which one day we hope we may collaborate with.

Now, let's consider the next question:

- What really are the essential differences amongst Wework, Airbnb and Les Nomades Mobile?

  - _Wework is a place for people to work._

  - _Airbnb is a place for people to sleep._

  - _Les Nomades Mobile is a place for people to eat._

- Can we not have ___a place for people to eat, work and sleep?___

_"Well, of course we cannot. Because then this will help the poor and eliminate the homeless .... and ...."_

We suppose you may be able to figure out the rest of the excuses to be made by freedom loving Americans.
