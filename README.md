## &mdash; _A Shared Economy Platform to Cook, Work and Live_
- _Programmers just need to learn cooking; and then ...._



&mdash; What are the lessons we can learn from Wework, arguably the biggest blunder in the history of shared economy startups? 

It is liquidity. By liquidity, we do not just mean liquidity of money, but also that of knowledge.

Consider food delivery services. No doubt they have created many jobs for low level skill people. However, there is not much sharing of knowledge, or liquidity of knowledge, ie. training for career advancement amongst the delivery personnel. 

On the other hand, cooks are a matured industry, with well established training and career development pathways. 

So the first question is:

- What relates Wework, food delivery riders, cooks and Airbnb?

Let's break this down to a simpler question:

- Is it possible to create a share economy platform for cooks?

The answer is a cooking class party &mdash; 

- a chef recruits 5 apprentice; each apprentice gets 5 friends; 
- each friend pays USD 10 up front for the party; 
- chef leads students to buy materials using the funds collected from friends;
- chef and students cook for friends; 
- extra materials are cooked, packed and sold; 
- profits are paid back to cook, students and friends.

This one simple paragraph above covers a classic investment life cycle worthy of an MBA class: 
- _everything from investment (funds from friends) to dividends (profits paid pack) within a few days, as well as sharing knowledge (cooking, marketing, management etc.) and contacts (friends of friends)._

3) How does the cooking class party (CCP) relate to Wework?

- Acute readers might have notice the acronym of cooking class party relates to a top taboo word in the freedom loving America. (LOLOL!!!)

Wework's Achilles's heels is exactly liquidity. It needs to generate cash income from its investments in real estates. 

Of course we do not even expect anyone from Wework would listen to our suggestions, for if there is one thing we have learned from the past, that is human nature has become so bad that good ideas will be rejected by bad people at the top to save face, to futher personal interests until it is no longer sustainable.

Assuming as little as possible about Wework's business, we making the following assumptions concerning the "bleeding" factors of Wework (or any similar businesses):

i) Some tenants of Wework are not making money.

ii) Some facilities of Wework have a hard time finding tenants.

In any case, we may also assume that Wework facilities are strategically located in the best spots in big hot urban areas.

As Cooking Class Parties has the same acronym as China Communist Party, we should not be ashamed to say that turning Wework facilities into "community kitchens" (having the same root as "Communism" too) might just be the magic potion that it needs to save itself.

In fact, from the operational perspective, what is required might just be a "minor upgrade" of kitchens in Wework facilities, so that it is large and well equipped enough to sustain the head count in the non-kitchen floor space.

Then of course, the next question is planning permissions &mdash; which in turn are related to to local authorities ....

We suppose the "startup gurus" in Wework board should be intelligent enough to figure out the rest. What we cannot predict are just the excuses they might use to reject this idea. (LOLOL!!!)


4. Let's call this business "Les Nomades Mobile" if CCP is too much a taboo for some readers.

We will be frank we are not even sure if this name is correct grammatically in French. By definition, nomads are mobile people. Adding a "mobile" suffix is purely to emphasize to English readers its closeness to mobile social media, and to differentiate it with one Michelin class restaurant somewhere, which one day we hope we may collaborate with.

Now, let's consider the next question:

- What really are the essential differences amongst Wework, Airbnb and Les Nomades Mobile?

  - _Wework is a place for people to work._

  - _Airbnb is a place for people to sleep._

  - _Les Nomades Mobile is a place for people to eat._

- Can we not have ___a place for people to eat, work and sleep?___

  - _"Well, of course we cannot. Because then this will help the poor and liberate, sorry, eliminate, whatever, .... the homeless .... and .... that would be ___COMMUNISM___!!!"_

We suppose you may be able to figure out the rest of the excuses to be made by freedom loving Americans.

5) After getting rid of some politically correct non-sense, we may now proceed to talk about how Les Nomades Mobile may merge with the business models of Airbnb and Wework.

- Consider Pareto's principle where the largest portion of Airbnb business belongs to small accomodations (less than 5 people) and large accomodations (more than 10 people) may have a hard time getting guests.

So large accomodations of Airbnb (or similar platforms) would be the ideal candidates to host Les Nomades Mobile Cooking Class Parties (LNM CCP).

Instead of just aiming at rich people with lots of cash to spend to host large group of people, LNM CCP are funded by people who are willing to invest small sums of money, to learn cooking and other skills, and expand these leisurely activities as businesses.


6) Digital nomads have become a fixture globally in far flung paradises in the past decade. Some of them may find it getting harder to make money to sustain their expenses.

- What would be better for digital nomads (programmers) to join Les Nomades Mobile (to learn cooking etc.)?

Programmers learning cooking is not a one way street. It is also a way for programmers, who are most likely equipped with more advanced management and business knowledge, to train locals running cafes and hostels.

So this is Les Nomades Mobile &mdash; _A Shared Economy Platform to Cook, Work and Live_ &mdash; perhaps the last type of share economy platform that has _NOT_ been developed by capitalists, not because it is not profitable, but because ".... _that would be_ ___COMMUNISM___ ...." (LOLOL!!!)

7) Hire van and container renovation experts. Do online contest.

Need mobile kitchen.

Chair, food truck, etc.

Renovate van as business.



Train people.

Caravan renovation. 

Les Nomades Mobile. Programmers just need to learn cooking.


CCP is the magic potion Wework needs to save itself!!

Use expand Wework office kitchens for CCP!!


1) 

We will use this article to invite Les Nomades to let us film their operations and if they are willing to collaborate, we will begin. 

The answer is Les Nomades Mobile. 


Find big Airbnb, the bigger the better, harder to find tenants, can fit in more people for cooking class.
