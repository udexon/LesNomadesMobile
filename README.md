Programmers just need to learn cooking; and the ....



What are the lessons we can learn from Wework, arguably the biggest blunder in the history of shared economy startups? 

It is liquidity. By liquidity, we do not just mean liquidity of money, but also that of knowledge.

Consider food delivery services. No doubt they have created many jobs for low level skill people. However, there is not much sharing of knowledge, or liquidity of knowledge, ie. training for career advancement amongst the delivery personnel. 

On the other hand, cooks are a matured industry, with well established training and career development pathways. 

So the first question is:

- What relates Wework, food delivery riders, cooks and Airbnb?

Let's break this down to a simpler question:

- Is it possible to create a share economy platform for cooks?

The answer is a cooking class party &mdash; 

- a chef recruits 5 apprentice; each apprentice gets 5 friends; - each friend pays USD 10 up front for the party; - chef leads students to buy materials using the funds collected from friends;- chef and students cook for friends; - extra materials are cooked, packed and sold; - profits are paid back to cook, students and friends.

This one simple paragraph covers a classic investment life cycle worthy of an MBA class: everything from investment (funds from friends) to dividends (profits paid pack) within a few days, as well as sharing knowledge (cooking, marketing, management etc.) and contacts (friends of friends).

3) How does the cooking class party (CCP) relate to Wework?

- Acute readers might have notice the acronym of cooking class party relates to a top taboo word in the freedom loving America. (LOLOL!!!)

CCP is the magic potion Wework needs to save itself!!

Use expand Wework office kitchens for CCP!!

Wework's Achilles's heels is exactly liquidity. It needs to generate cash income from its investments in real estates. 

Of course we do not even expect anyone from Wework would listen to our suggestions, for if there is one thing we have learned from the past, that is human nature has become so bad that good ideas will be rejected by bad people to save face, to futher personal interests until it is no longer sustainable.

Let's call this business "Les Nomades Mobile" if CCP is too much a taboo for some readers.

I will be frank I am not even sure if this name is correct grammatically in French. By definition, nomads are mobile people. Adding a "mobile" suffix is purely to emphasize its closeness to mobile social media, and to differentiate it with one super Michelin class restaurant somewhere, which one day we may collaborate with.
